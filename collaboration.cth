  Storytelling is an inherently collaborative activity. Stories naturally lead 
  to questions, which lead to discussions, which lead to deeper analysis.
  In addition to being a good way to present data, stories
  also offer an effective means of packaging information
  and knowledge in a way that is easy for another person
  to understand.
