  Any visualisation can be used as part of a story, but some techniques lend 
  themselves to storytelling better 
  than others. For example, techniques such as the 
  connected scatterplot, in which the points are connected 
  with a line in some order, or the slope graph, essentially 
  a single-axis pair from parallel coordinates, generally are 
  not very useful for analysis. However, they can be quite 
  effective as storytelling devices for specific data. How well 
  they work depends not only on the data structure but also 
  on actual values. If the connected scatterplot results in 
  a large number of tangled lines, it does not provide any 
  value, but if the values change relatively smoothly and 
  Opening up a visualisation for interaction 
  at the storyâ€™s end provides a convenient 
  starting point for exploration and goes 
  beyond a simple slideshow.
